        <p " style =color:#00FF7F;">Numbers 1,2,3,4,5 and so on used to count are called counting numbers.Counting numbers are also
           called natural numbers. Since counting begins with 1,1 is the first and the smallest natural number.</p>

        <p " style =color:#00FF7F;">Can you tell the......... last natural number?</p>

        <p " style = color:#00FF7F;">Counting numbers have no end. This means that there is no last or greatest natural number. Thus,
           Natural numbers are infinite.</p>
